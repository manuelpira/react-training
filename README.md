##Introduction

###What is react?
React is a JavaScript library that's used for building user interfaces. 

###From where it came from?
It started at Facebook and it's maintained by developers at Facebook and Instagram and also a huge community of contributors.

###What's de difference between React and some other js libraries like Angular or Backbone?
React is intended to be the view or the user interface, the V in MVC. One of the benefits and goals of the React project is to make developing a large scale single page application or SPA, much easier.

###Virtual DOM?
Probably the most exciting feature of React though is the virtual DOM. Whenever a change happens the virtual DOM efficiently re-renders the DOM. 

##The Goods and the bads

1. You can always tell how your component will render by looking at one source file.
2. Bundling Javascript and HTML into JSX makes components easily understandable.
3. You can render React on the server.
